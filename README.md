- With Animate enabled it will only show one slide at a time, it will not work with multiple images at once.

**Animate/Transitions for Owl-Carousel**:
By default the Animate is disabled, to enable do the following. The instructions coincide with index.html file for reference.
- 1. In the html file comment out line: 127 and uncomment line: 128.
- 2. Line 132 change <img src= to <img data-src= and add owl-lazy to class="card-img-top". 
    (Do this with all that follow, Lines: 138,144,150,156 & 162).
- 3. Line 430 change owl.carousel.slider.js to owl.carousel.slider-with-animate.js.

This can be applied to index.html, news.html and coding.html but line numbers will change in all files.
